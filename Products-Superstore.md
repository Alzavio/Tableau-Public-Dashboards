This dashboard was created by @Alzavio using sample data. This dashboard aims to not just give the end user a summary of what is going on with products at the company, but answer the following specific business questions concerning products: 
- Which products are sold where and to whom.
- How does current performance compare to the previous years' YTD by each category.
- Which products (subcategories) make up the majority of sales.



### Logic dashboard design

**Why use both colours and circles on the map to display the same data?**

The reason is two fold. Having both the circles and the colours show the difference between the sales and profit figures better than either individually. The colours better give the user an idea of the differences between the states and geographic trends at a glance, and the circles give a better visual comparison between two states of similar values that colours do. 

The secondary reason is for when there is negative profit. The circles cannot have a negative size, so that's when the colours are most important.
